# Week 5 Tutorial Notes

## Composite Pattern

A client has come to us with the following request for their online store:

I would like you to develop an order system for my univeristy student supplys store (we sell textbooks, two minute noodles, coffee, pens, laptops). Our end user should be able to create orders of individual items that each have a price and a name. They should also be able to group together multiple items into a basket and the resulting price will be the sum of the individual prices. The customer should also be able to apply coupons (percentage, flat amount off, or minimum of the two) to baskets of items. Finally, we would like combo deals - where a student can have a basket of items at normal price but two of them, for example coffee and two minute noodles are a percentage, flat amount off, or minimum of the two cheaper.
